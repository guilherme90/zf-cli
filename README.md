# ZF CLI

### Motivation
After a while working with other frameworks, I realized that the cli for Zend 2 is quite precarious. For this reason I am donating my time to improve this and make life easier for the developers!

### Functionalities
- [x] Create module
- [x] Create controller
- [x] Create action

All commands have a guide on how to use it. It is very simple, easy and fast! 

### How to use
```bash
$ ./bin/zf-cli
```

After run this command, the output will be:

**Welcome to Zend Framework CLI**
