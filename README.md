# ZF CLI [![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/guilherme90/zf-cli/tree/master.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/guilherme90/zf-cli/tree/master)

### Motivation
After a while working with other frameworks, I realized that the cli for Zend 2 is quite precarious. For this reason I am donating my time to improve this and make life easier for the developers!

### Functionalities
- [x] Create module

All commands have a guide on how to use it. It is very simple, easy and fast!
